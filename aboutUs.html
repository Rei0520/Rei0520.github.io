                    Behind all our classic and new collections is a story that defines our company.

                    <p class="reveal active">
                        Before Reebok, there was J.W. Foster and Sons, 
                        a humble British family business with many achievements of its own. 
                        A pioneer in spiked running shoes, 
                        the company began cementing its reputation for creating footwear fit for the competition.
                    </p>

                    <p class="reveal active">
                        Besides spiked running shoes, 
                        J.W. Foster & Sons also developed running pumps, which were shoes that allowed the wearer to pump them for extra power. 
                        These extraordinary shoes were famously worn by Harold Abrahams at the Paris Olympics, 
                        who brought gold for his nation at the 100m sprint.
                    </p>

                    <p class="reveal active">
                        Since then, J.W. Foster and Sons began to make a name for itself, 
                        being worn by some of the era's best Olympic athletes.

                    <p class="reveal active">
                        In 1958, Joe and Jeff Foster formed the companion company Reebok. 
                        The idea came from the name of a type of antelope, 
                        which the two read about from a South African dictionary that Joe Foster won during his youth.

                        Ever since the birth of this new brand, Reebok continued its path to excellence, 
                        expanding its reach to the rest of the globe. 
                        Our company started introducing all kinds of clothes and accessories fit for physical activity.

                    <p>
                        This was also the start of many of our brands classic collections, 
                        including the Newport Classic (NPC) range, Reebok Classic Leather, 
                        and our iconic 'Pump' basketball shoes.

                    <p>
                        In addition, our brand also started working together with some well-known members of society, 
                        including NBA star Shaquille O'Neal, and famous rapper Jay Z, 
                        as well as some sporting organizations such as the NFL and CrossFit.
